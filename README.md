# Inbox Manager

This is a (hopefully) simple project dedicated to help me keep me inbox clean as well as notify me of any actually important emails. The scope of this project includes:

- delete junk email
- delete emails that do not pertain to me
- automatically add assignment due dates to my google calander
- automatically add cool events I want to go to to my google calander
- sort emails that I want to keep into folders

## Plan
Right now my very surface level concept of a plan is to use a LLM/agent/something AI to analyze the email content and make a decision about the fate of the email (delete, sort, flag, extract to calander) automatically.

I will first focus on my @utdallas.edu email because it gets the most cluttered and is the most important in my day to day life, but hope to expand to my gmails as well.

I will launch this manager on my personal server to keep it active 24/7 and plan to host my own LLM or agent to make decisions for me because I have a server with a gpu and I might as well use it.

If this is actually useful, I might consider launching this into an app people other than me can use.
